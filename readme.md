disappearing argument parser

This is admittedly a little :microscope: mad science. The gist is that zeroarg
is an argument parser, with [yargs](https://github.com/yargs/yargs) at its
core, that doesn't require you to touch yargs, or argument-parsing specifics.
It aims to infer types and reuse documentation to do that.

Here's an example CLI written with zeroarg:

```js
var zeroarg = require('zeroarg');

zeroarg(() =>
  /**
   * Add numbers together
   * @param {Array<number>} numbers
   */
  function add(numbers) {
    console.log(numbers.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0));
  }
);
```

This produces proper help material:

```js
Commands:
  run [numbers..]

Options:
  --help  Show help     [boolean]

Add numbers together
```

And adds numbers together when you run it:

```js
$ ./examples/add.js run 1 2 3 4
10
```

## Why?

* Argument parsing still feels like a source of uncertainty in programming: it's like
  the same as parsing query arguments, except for the CLI: you're getting who knows what
  from who knows who. Your program has types and expectations - maybe even official types
  with Flowtype - and yet argument parsers make you redeclare those types, or even
  allow untyped, unexpected input. What if argument parsers leveraged your program's
  existing assumptions and treated CLIs more like functions?
* It's possibly a little less code to write, and one less API to learn! zeroarg's
  API surface is one function, and it uses existing standards (JSDoc & Flow)
  to express assumptions about argument types.
* It's super fun and weird.
